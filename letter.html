    <h2>To the One I Love Most 💖</h2>
    <p>
Alright... you're <em>so</em> beautiful that I could look at you forever. Especially those eyes...<br><br>

Talking about your eyes... they're so deep, once someone falls into them, there’s no way back. Deep like the ocean. Beautiful like the moon. Angel-like eyes.<br><br>

Once I fell, I just kept falling. There’s no coming out.<br>
And trust me, I could go on and on... but let’s end “eyes” here for now.<br><br>

Your face... that smile.<br>
Whenever you smile and I’m looking at you, I just can’t control my own smile. I start blushing so hard.<br>
That little glimpse I once saw is still stuck in my mind – fresh as ever.<br><br>

And your hair... you’ve got these curly-type locks. Reminds me of my mom, honestly. The way you care for me too – it’s kinda similar to how she did when I was younger.<br>
I know you’d look <em>soooo</em> beautiful if you did your hair up properly once.<br><br>

Your voice?<br>
God... it’s enough to calm me, relax me, give me peace.<br>
Even when you're upset, your voice still sounds beautiful — soft and low — when you say <em>“Panda, I’m missing you...”</em><br>
It’s beautiful... but also a little sad, because I know you're not okay. And I just wanna be there for you.<br><br>

Your heart?<br>
Yeah, I <strong>proudly</strong> say... it's <strong>mine</strong>.<br>
You’ve got the kindest, purest heart.<br>
You’ve faced so much at such a young age — and that made your heart even more beautiful.<br>
I <em>truly</em> respect you for that. And I’m proud that your heart belongs to me.<br><br>

Your personality?<br>
It’s something words can’t explain.<br><br>

You’re kind.<br>
You’re mature.<br>
You know how to deal with problems.<br>
You’re shy (and I absolutely LOVE that about you).<br>
You're beautiful from the inside out — and I’m <em>so lucky</em> to have you in my life.<br><br>

You’re scared to lose me.<br>
And honestly... I’m scared too.<br>
Meri jaan, without you... there’s not much left. Just a huge kingdom... and a little boy who's finally happy.<br><br>

You hold pain inside. You’re willing to sacrifice for the ones you love.<br>
You’re so good from the inside, I know you’d do anything for someone you care about.<br>
And that’s exactly why I wish nothing but happiness for you.<br><br>

I want to be the one who gives you that happiness.<br>
Because you <strong>deserve it.</strong><br>
You changed my life completely.<br><br>

It’s been a little over a year since we met… and I swear, you’re so special — I want you forever.<br>
I want you to <em>realize your worth</em>.<br>
I want you to <em>see how beautiful you are</em>.<br>
I want to give you the <em>love you truly deserve</em>.<br>
I want you to <em>feel</em> how amazing you are.<br><br>

I wanna sit beneath the moon with you... look into your eyes… and just talk for hours.<br>
I want to grow up with you.<br>
I want to hold your hand (but ONLY when it’s halal — never before, never ever).<br><br>

I wanna see you laugh every day.<br>
Because today, I saw a glimpse of it… and it was something I’ll never forget.<br>
So pretty — I can’t even put it into words. It’s gonna stay fresh in my mind forever.<br><br>

And when our eyes met — even just for a few seconds — I saw the most beautiful eyes I’ve ever seen.<br>
No doubt about it.<br><br>

I’m in love with those eyes.<br><br>

When you’re shy... you're even <em>cuter</em>.<br>
The way you react to what I do… it’s so cute that even I start shying and blushing.<br>
And when you say “Panda, I miss you… Panda, I love you…”<br><br>

I melt like ice in fire.<br><br>

You’re the best.<br>
And I’ll never stop loving you.<br>
No matter what happens, I’ll stay by your side.<br>
If something goes wrong, it’s okay — we’ll deal with it.<br>
I’ll be there through every situation.<br>
Because your problems?<br>
They’re <em>our</em> problems now.<br><br>

<strong>I love you.<br>
Forever.</strong>
